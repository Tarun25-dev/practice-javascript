6d.Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children (6 years and younger) or seniors (65 years and older).
Create a variable 'age' and save a person's age inside.
Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for a discount. If they do, display 'Discount' in the console. Otherwise, display 'No discount' in the console.
Note: try to use the || operator in your solution.
Try changing the 'age' variable to display different messages.
6e.Continuing from excercise,
let's say the discount is only available if it is not a holiday. Create a variable: const isHoliday = true;
Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must meet the age requirement and it is also not a holiday.
Note: && has a higher priority than || so you may need to use brackets () to control which code gets done first.
Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages.
